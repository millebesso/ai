* [How I program with LLMs](https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-llms) - _"Some days I mostly write typescript, some days mostly Go. I spent a week in a C++ codebase last month exploring an idea, and just had an opportunity to learn the HTTP server-side events format.

* [How I use LLMs as a staff engineer](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/) - _"LLMs excel at writing code that works that doesn’t have to be maintained.
