* [Cartography of generative AI](https://cartography-of-generative-ai.net/) - Big map provding an overview of the LLM ecosystem.

## Comparisons

* [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) - Artificial Analysis provides benchmarking and related information to support people & organizations in choosing the right model for their use-case and which provider to use for that model. 
* [Roblox' OpenGameEval](https://github.com/Roblox/open-game-eval/) - Roblox has an evaluation framework for testing LLMs on Roblox game develoment tasks and keep a leaderboard of the results.

## Engineering usage

* [How I program with LLMs](https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-llms) - _"Some days I mostly write typescript, some days mostly Go. I spent a week in a C++ codebase last month exploring an idea, and just had an opportunity to learn the HTTP server-side events format. I am all over the place, constantly forgetting and relearning."_
* [How I use LLMs as a staff engineer](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/) - _"LLMs excel at writing code that works that doesn’t have to be maintained. Non-production code that’s only run once (e.g. for research) is a perfect fit for this. I would say that my use of LLMs here meant I got this done 2x-4x faster than if I’d been unassisted."_
* [I quit my FAANG job because it'll be automated by the end of 2025 ](https://jagilley.github.io/faang-blog.html) - _"All in all, I think the evidence points to a scenario where by the end of this year or next, engineering and other pure knowledge work IC jobs can be mostly done by AI agents, with some fraction of the people who formerly held those IC jobs acting as de facto product managers come infrastructure janitors for agent swarms. "_
* [The role of developer skills in agentic coding](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai.html#memo-13) - _"Stop AI coding sessions when you feel overwhelmed by what’s going on. Either revise your prompt and start a new session, or fall back to manual implementation - “artisanal coding”, as my colleague Steve Upton calls it."_
* [Senior Developer Skills in the AI Age: Leveraging Experience for Better Results](https://manuel.kiessling.net/2025/03/31/how-seasoned-developers-can-achieve-great-results-with-ai-coding-agents/) - _"By providing well-structured requirements, implementing appropriate guardrails, and using file-based keyframing, we can harness the power of AI while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity. These time-tested practices, and more than anything else, hard-earned human experience with these practices, are more valuable than ever in the age of AI-assisted development, and far from obsolete."_
* [Ask HN: AI Replacing Engineers – Firsthand Stories?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43831122) - _"I would consider myself today 2-3x more effective than where I was 12 months ago."_
* [Take aways from coding with AI](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/takeaways-from-coding-with-ai/) - _"In this regard, I was struck by Camille Fournier’s assertion that managers love to see their senior developers using AI tools, because they have the skills and judgment to get the most out of it, but often want to take it away from junior developers who can use it too uncritically."_
* [AI Changes Everything](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/) - _" It does not feel like the rise of search engines or social media, where the rest of the world was satisfied with being a consumer of US infrastructure. This feels more like the invention of the steam engine. Once it existed, there was no future without it. No country could afford to stay on the sidelines. But steam machines also became quickly commoditized and there was plenty of competition of manufacturers. It was just too obvious of a technological leap."_
* [Building a Personal AI Factory (July 2025 snapshot)](https://www.john-rush.com/posts/ai-20250701.html) - _"I keep several claude code windows open, each on its own git-worktree. o3 and sonnet 4 create plans, sonnet 3.7 or sonnet 4 execute the plan, and o3 checks the results against the original ask. Any issues found are fed back into the plan template and the code is regenerated. The factory improves itself...When something goes wrong, I don’t hand-patch the generated code. I don’t argue with claude. Instead, I adjust the plan, the prompts, or the agent mix so the next run is correct by construction."_
* [Building your own CLI Coding Agent with Pydantic-AI](https://martinfowler.com/articles/build-own-coding-agent.html) - _"Think of it like learning to cook. You can eat at restaurants forever but understanding how flavours combine and techniques work makes you appreciate food differently - and lets you create exactly what you want."_
* [Getting AI to Work in Complex Codebases](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md) - _"The techniques I want to talk about and that we've adopted in the last few months fall under what I call "frequent intentional compaction". Essentially, this means designing your ENTIRE WORKFLOW around context management"_
* [DORA: State of AI-assisted Software Development](https://dora.dev/research/2025/dora-report/) - _"AI’s primary role in software development is that of an amplifier. It magnifies the strengths of highperforming organizations and the dysfunctions of struggling ones. The greatest returns on AI investment come not from the tools themselves, but from a strategic focus on the underlying organizational system: the quality of the internal platform, the clarity of workflows, and the alignment of teams. Without this foundation, AI creates localized pockets of productivity that are often lost to downstream chaos."_
* [Introducing Beads: A coding agent memory system](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/introducing-beads-a-coding-agent-memory-system-637d7d92514a) - Written by Steve Yegge, one of my favorite developer writers: _"Beads is a lightweight memory system for coding agents, using a graph-based issue tracker. Four kinds of dependencies work to chain your issues together like beads, making them easy for agents to follow for long distances, and reliably perform complex task streams in the right order."_
* [You should write an agent](https://fly.io/blog/everyone-write-an-agent/) - _"Some concepts are easy to grasp in the abstract. Boiling water: apply heat and wait. Others you really need to try. You only think you understand how a bicycle works, until you learn to ride one. There are big ideas in computing that are easy to get your head around. The AWS S3 API. It’s the most important storage technology of the last 20 years, and it’s like boiling water. Other technologies, you need to get your feet on the pedals first. LLM agents are like that."_
* [Three Years from GPT-3 to Gemini 3](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/three-years-from-gpt-3-to-gemini) - _"Gemini 3 is a very good thinking and doing partner that is available to billions of people around the world...The era of the chatbot is turning into the era of the digital coworker."_
* [Writing a good CLAUDE.md](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md) - To be honest, I don't know if this is good advice or just advice. That said, keeping a file that describes a project and it's code base is never a bad thing.
* [A Month of Chat-Oriented Programming](https://checkeagle.com/checklists/njr/a-month-of-chat-oriented-programming/) - This is a very well written piece on the experience of working with Claude for a full month. Lots of very good tips and tricks!
* [Using LLMs at Oxide](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576) - Possibly the best text I've read on using LLMs in a tech organization. Full of good tidbits such as the breakdown of the different roles LLMs can take and how to manage is of those roles.
* [Why Your CTO Might Start Coding Again](https://davegriffith.substack.com/p/why-your-cto-might-start-coding-again) - _"The brutal economics of $150/hour shaped everything about how we built software. Only developers could create code, there weren’t enough of them, and they couldn’t do it very fast. Every process, every tool, every org structure optimized around that constraint...Then agentic AI made code production nearly free, and a funny thing happened: all that “overhead” turned out to be the actual work."_
* [Has the cost of building software dropped 90%?](https://martinalderson.com/posts/has-the-cost-of-software-just-dropped-90-percent/) - Yet we don't see a large amount of seemingly low-cost, perhaps slightly good-enough offerings that are replacing existing apps or at least competing with them. Similarly with open source projects which is often the frontier for these types of shifts.
* [How I wrote JustHTML using coding agents](https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/) - A very interesting breakdown of writing a pure Python html-parser using primarily agents but based on a pre-existing set of tests. Goes through the different steps in the development process and the role of the developer vs. the role of the Agent(s).
* [Just in time software](https://commaok.xyz/ai/just-in-time-software/) - I think there needs to be another name to what this is. There's a huge gap between software as in how we used to know it and the throw-away apps described here. The main reason what is done in this article is software is because it (still) requires a tech background to perform it, give it a few more iterations and what we have is a very capable personal assistant who may or may not write code. But it's not the same thing as software.
* [AI Coding Assistants Are Getting Worse Newer models are more prone to silent but deadly failure modes](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-coding-degrades) - _"But as soon as AI coding assistants arrived and were integrated into coding environments, the model creators realized they had a powerful source of labelled training data: the behavior of the users themselves. If an assistant offered up suggested code, the code ran successfully, and the user accepted the code, that was a positive signal, a sign that the assistant had gotten it right. If the user rejected the code, or if the code failed to run, that was a negative signal, and when the model was retrained, the assistant would be steered in a different direction."_
* [Which programming languages are most token-efficient?](https://martinalderson.com/posts/which-programming-languages-are-most-token-efficient/) - Interesting metric on measuring how many tokens are used to perform the same task in different languages. The results are not surprising.
* [The Emperor Has No Clothes: How to Code Claude Code in 200 Lines of Code](https://www.mihaileric.com/The-Emperor-Has-No-Clothes/) - Another example of the simplicity of coding agents.

## Identity

* [AI agent identity: it's just OAuth](https://mayakaczorowski.com/blogs/ai-agent-authentication) - _"Either your OS will need to give you a reasonable way to limit what a local agent does, or an app will need to give you a reasonable way to separate ‘who’ is taking an action, or both."_

## Projects

* [Project Vend: Can Claude run a small shop? (And why does that matter?)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1) - _"Although it did not take advantage of many lucrative opportunities (see below), Claudius did make several pivots in its business that were responsive to customers. An employee light-heartedly requested a tungsten cube, kicking off a trend of orders for “specialty metal items” (as Claudius later described them)."_
