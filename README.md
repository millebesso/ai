## Theory 

* [Deep dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://anfalmushtaq.com/articles/deep-dive-into-llms-like-chatgpt-tldr) - A TL;DR of a longer video (linked) of how LLMs work.

## Comparisons

* [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) - Artificial Analysis provides benchmarking and related information to support people & organizations in choosing the right model for their use-case and which provider to use for that model. 

## Engineering usage

* [How I program with LLMs](https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-llms) - _"Some days I mostly write typescript, some days mostly Go. I spent a week in a C++ codebase last month exploring an idea, and just had an opportunity to learn the HTTP server-side events format. I am all over the place, constantly forgetting and relearning."_
* [How I use LLMs as a staff engineer](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/) - _"LLMs excel at writing code that works that doesn’t have to be maintained. Non-production code that’s only run once (e.g. for research) is a perfect fit for this. I would say that my use of LLMs here meant I got this done 2x-4x faster than if I’d been unassisted."_
* [I quit my FAANG job because it'll be automated by the end of 2025 ](https://jagilley.github.io/faang-blog.html) - _"All in all, I think the evidence points to a scenario where by the end of this year or next, engineering and other pure knowledge work IC jobs can be mostly done by AI agents, with some fraction of the people who formerly held those IC jobs acting as de facto product managers come infrastructure janitors for agent swarms. "_
* [The role of developer skills in agentic coding](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai.html#memo-13) - _"Stop AI coding sessions when you feel overwhelmed by what’s going on. Either revise your prompt and start a new session, or fall back to manual implementation - “artisanal coding”, as my colleague Steve Upton calls it."_
* [Senior Developer Skills in the AI Age: Leveraging Experience for Better Results](https://manuel.kiessling.net/2025/03/31/how-seasoned-developers-can-achieve-great-results-with-ai-coding-agents/) - _"By providing well-structured requirements, implementing appropriate guardrails, and using file-based keyframing, we can harness the power of AI while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity. These time-tested practices, and more than anything else, hard-earned human experience with these practices, are more valuable than ever in the age of AI-assisted development, and far from obsolete."_
* [Ask HN: AI Replacing Engineers – Firsthand Stories?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43831122) - _"I would consider myself today 2-3x more effective than where I was 12 months ago."_
* [Take aways from coding with AI](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/takeaways-from-coding-with-ai/) - _"In this regard, I was struck by Camille Fournier’s assertion that managers love to see their senior developers using AI tools, because they have the skills and judgment to get the most out of it, but often want to take it away from junior developers who can use it too uncritically."_
* [AI Changes Everything](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/) - _" It does not feel like the rise of search engines or social media, where the rest of the world was satisfied with being a consumer of US infrastructure. This feels more like the invention of the steam engine. Once it existed, there was no future without it. No country could afford to stay on the sidelines. But steam machines also became quickly commoditized and there was plenty of competition of manufacturers. It was just too obvious of a technological leap."_
* [Building a Personal AI Factory (July 2025 snapshot)](https://www.john-rush.com/posts/ai-20250701.html) - _"I keep several claude code windows open, each on its own git-worktree. o3 and sonnet 4 create plans, sonnet 3.7 or sonnet 4 execute the plan, and o3 checks the results against the original ask. Any issues found are fed back into the plan template and the code is regenerated. The factory improves itself...When something goes wrong, I don’t hand-patch the generated code. I don’t argue with claude. Instead, I adjust the plan, the prompts, or the agent mix so the next run is correct by construction."_

## Identity

* [AI agent identity: it's just OAuth](https://mayakaczorowski.com/blogs/ai-agent-authentication) - _"Either your OS will need to give you a reasonable way to limit what a local agent does, or an app will need to give you a reasonable way to separate ‘who’ is taking an action, or both."_

## Projects

* [Project Vend: Can Claude run a small shop? (And why does that matter?)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1) - _"Although it did not take advantage of many lucrative opportunities (see below), Claudius did make several pivots in its business that were responsive to customers. An employee light-heartedly requested a tungsten cube, kicking off a trend of orders for “specialty metal items” (as Claudius later described them)."_
