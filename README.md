## Engineering usage

* [How I program with LLMs](https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-llms) - _"Some days I mostly write typescript, some days mostly Go. I spent a week in a C++ codebase last month exploring an idea, and just had an opportunity to learn the HTTP server-side events format. I am all over the place, constantly forgetting and relearning."_
* [How I use LLMs as a staff engineer](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/) - _"LLMs excel at writing code that works that doesn’t have to be maintained. Non-production code that’s only run once (e.g. for research) is a perfect fit for this. I would say that my use of LLMs here meant I got this done 2x-4x faster than if I’d been unassisted."_

* [The role of developer skills in agentic coding](The role of developer skills in agentic coding) - _"Stop AI coding sessions when you feel overwhelmed by what’s going on. Either revise your prompt and start a new session, or fall back to manual implementation - “artisanal coding”, as my colleague Steve Upton calls it."_
